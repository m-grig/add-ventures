# Add Ventures

This is a turn based randomly-generated RPG game I wrote back in 2019.

It was written entirely in vanilla HTML, CSS, & JS. It was meant to be somewhat of an experiment of what is possible using basic html tags, and was written without using HTML canvas.

The balancing in this game makes it very difficult. If you want to not rage, you should probably modify the calculations for combat.

## Run locally

To run the game, simply clone the repo and open ./Game.htm in your browser.
