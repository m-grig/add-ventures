# Add Ventures

This is a turn based randomly generated RPG game, written entirely in vanilla HTML, CSS, & JS. It was written without using HTML canvas and is meant to be somewhat of an experiment of what is possible using basic html tags.

## Run locally

To run the game, simply clone the repo and open ./Game.htm in your browser.
